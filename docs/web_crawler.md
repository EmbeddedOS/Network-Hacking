# Website Hacking - Writing a crawler

- Information gathering:
  - IP address.
  - Domain name info.
  - Technologies used.
  - Other websites on the same server.
  - DNS records.
  - Files, sub-domain, directories.

- Crawling subdomains.
  - Domain before the actual domain name.
  - Part of the main domain.
  - Examples:
    - subdomain.target.com
    - mail.google.com
    - plus.google.com

- Therefore, if u are trying to hack into a website, u want to test all of these subdomains and u need to discovery all of them.
