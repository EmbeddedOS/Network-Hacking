# File interceptor

- Modifying data in HTTP layer
  - Edit requests/response.
  - Replace download requests.
  - Inject code (html/Javascript).
  - etc.

- We can intercept downloads that the target person is downloading, and whenever they want to download the program, for example, instead of them getting a program, they will actually get a `back door` ot a credential harvester or a virus or any other file that you want.
